## Min-max Algorithm

### Description

In the children's game of two people who stand facing each other at a distance A and have the ability to move D and d(D>d). The target is the solution to the problem using Dynamic Programming. The general idea is the use of Min-max regression to find the optimal solution of the individual sub-problems depending on the profile of each problem.


### Implementation

    1. Decision Trees(DT)
    2. Adversarial Search -- Min-Max algorithm


### Program configuration
    Input parameters
        1. The distance A between the two players
        2. The value of D
        3. The value of d


### Compile and Run
    gcc -Wall -o main.c
    ./main.o
